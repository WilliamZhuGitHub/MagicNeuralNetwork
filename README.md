Introduction

Why was the project undertaken?

We are both large fans of the card game Magic the Gathering, with the amount of cards that come out due to the popularity of the game. We were curious if a neural network could find a pattern in the art of the cards and if it correlated to their color.

What was the research question, the tested hypothesis, or
the purpose of the research?

Is there some pattern / theme that exists for knowing what color a card is due to the artwork.

Results 

What answer was found to the research question; what did
the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true? Any
visualizations?
 
Discussion 

What might the answer imply and why does it matter? How
does it fit in with what other researchers have found? What
are the perspectives for future research? Survey about the
tools investigated for this assignment.

Summary Conclusion of most important findings.
